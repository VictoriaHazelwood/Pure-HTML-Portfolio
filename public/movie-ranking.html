<h3><center>Eddie and the Cruisers</center></h3>
   <p>Tom Berenger, Michael Par√©, and some killer saxaphone solos, need I say more? Okay, if I need to say more, it was made in the 80s and that should be all you need to know.</p>
<h3><center>Almost Famous</center></h3>
   <p>Kate Hudson as Penny Lane truly makes you question why all women didn't want to be groupies.
     Anything but Airplanes Tour 2024, here I come! </p>
<h3><center><Death to Stalin</center></h3>
    <p>A feel-good dark comedy for when you feel like you need a laugh while hating governments.</p>
<h3><center>Marie Antoinette</center></h3>
    <p>Kirsten Dunst, Jason Schwatrzman, and Director, Sofia Coppola, created a true masterpiece in every sense of the word.
       Everything about the movie makes you feel like you are in a Juicy Couture ad from 2006. Now that I think about it, I slightly remember them running Marie Antoinette themed ads in Teen Vogue back in the day that had poodles with their fur dyed all different pastel colors...What a time to be alive...</p>
